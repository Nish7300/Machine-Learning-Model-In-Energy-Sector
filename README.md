Predict Costumer Churn In Energy Sector
I Built a Machine Learning Model to Predict Customer Churn in the Energy Sector üë®‚Äçüíª ( I'm sharing some insights with you )

üëã I'm thrilled to share a recent milestone - I successfully developed and deployed a machine learning model that predicts customer churn in the energy industry using a RandomForestClassifier.

What's in the Data???

I worked with a dataset that contains information about energy consumption, forecasts, and customer details. After some data magic (handling missing values and encoding categories), I trained the model on features like cons_12m, forecast_cons_12m, and channel information.

Key Steps I Took :

1. Data Cleanup:- Got the dataset in tip-top shape by handling missing info and encoding categories.
2. Model Training:- Used scikit-learn's RandomForestClassifier for the heavy lifting in training the model.
3. Metrics Matter:- Checked how well my model is doing using metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1 Score.
4.Results Snapshot -: Drumroll, please! The model's rocking a cool 90% accuracy, with a precision of 76% and a recall of 4%. Check out the confusion matrix for the nitty-gritty.

Performance Metrics Breakdown:
Accuracy: 90%
Precision: 76%
Recall: 4%
F1 Score: 8%

I'm buzzing with excitement about where this project could go.
If you're in the energy sector or just curious about machine learning, let's chat! I'm all ears for collaboration, insights, or just a friendly discussion about the fascinating world of data science.
